								I am a free spirited individual, I have known in life that people change continuously and there's nothing you can do to stop that change. Another observation I have had is that everything is inherently broken, but hopefully it can be fixed. I enjoy long walks along the beach or country side, In my free time I enjoy drawing, my friends call me carefree and I usually don't fret about things so I guess :p. I have a keen interest in learning languages and I am fascinated by optical illusions, I always thought I knew what i wanted to do in my life (and I was wrong), but life seems to be more than being summed up in few words. I also play video games, read books, draw and ponder about life and situations I have been in. I enjoy talking to people and learning about their lives and experiences they have had, feel free to contact me if you want to talk about something or want to get to know me better.
